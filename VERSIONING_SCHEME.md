# Versioning Scheme

For PyPuns we use a custom Versioning Scheme that is described after.


## Description

The version number we use is:  
```MAJOR.MINOR.LANGUAGE_NUMBER.LANGUAGE_INSERTIONS```

You need to increment the numbers for:

- **MAJOR** version when you make major code or working method changes,
- **MINOR** version when you add small features,
- **LANGUAGE_NUMBER** version when you add a new languag,
- **LANGUAGE_INSERTIONS** version when you add puns to an existing language.
